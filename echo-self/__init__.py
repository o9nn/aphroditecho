"""
Echo-Self AI Evolution Engine

A self-optimizing AI system that evolves neural network topologies and
architectures using genetic algorithms integrated with the Deep Tree Echo
System Network (DTESN).

This module provides:
- Core evolution interfaces and protocols
- Basic evolutionary operators (mutation, selection, crossover)  
- Neural network topology evolution capabilities
- Integration with DTESN and Aphrodite Engine
