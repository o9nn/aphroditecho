# ACADEMIC SYNOPSIS & GLOSSARY OF SYSTEM BASICS:
Robert Campbell 2006

Note: This requires careful reflection on the System diagrams. It takes concentrated attention over a period of time to
understand well. It is intended for those who may be faced with the need to express new concepts in language. While the
System cannot be reduced to language one can see how the meanings implicit in words derive from the structural
dynamics of the Cosmic Order that has directed our biological and social evolution.  

## The System:
The System is a method of delineating the structural and dynamical properties of the cosmic order. It
encompasses all of the structural possibilities of phenomenal experience with respect to active interfaces
between a universal inside or center and a universal outside or periphery. This includes living processes. It is a
property of the System that it should find confirmation in phenomenal experience. It is likewise a property of the
System that it has no origin in space or time. The nature of space and time is defined by the System itself as it
relates to the projection of the physical universe.  

## Efflux:
Efflux is defined as the active flowing forth or explicit expression of ordered energy processes issuing from the
universal inside to the universal outside across one or more active interfaces between them. The nature of
efflux is progressively qualified by the way the System proliferates. Macroscopic example: A human being is an
active interface with the physical environment that can use biochemical energy processes in efflux to throw a
ball.

## Reflux:
Reflux is defined as the flowing back or relatively passive return of ordered energy processes feeding back to
the universal inside from the universal passive outside across one or more active interfaces between them. The
nature of reflux is progressively qualified by the way the System proliferates. Macroscopic example: Physical
and biochemical energy processes in passive reflux via the visual sense allow the human being to see the ball
in flight.

## Center:
Since all active interfaces exhibit a universal active inside or center within them they are called Centers for
convenience. Since the active center within active interfaces consists of ordered energy related to
electromagnetic energy it is likewise called light for convenience. The active universal center is progressively
defined by the way the System proliferates.

## Periphery:
Since all active interfaces or Centers relate to a passive universal outside or periphery, and since it is
convenient to call the active center light, it is likewise convenient to call the passive outside darkness. We can
thus relate the efflux of light from an active center to a passive universal periphery in darkness. This simplifies
descriptions. The passive universal periphery is progressively defined by the way the System proliferates.

## Universal Wholeness:
Since the System is a method of delineating the structural dynamics of the cosmic order embracing all possible
structural possibilities of experience, it is founded on the single Janus-faced concept that there is a universal
wholeness both embracing all possible phenomena and from which all phenomena derive. The System can
allow of nothing more fundamental than itself with the single requirement that it must find consistency with
phenomena. Traditional approaches begin at the other end, with a complex diversity of fragmented
phenomena, from which universal laws and unified theories are sought. The System elaborates on itself in such
a way that it can assimilate the evidence that has been amassed by traditional approaches in more meaningful
integrated ways.

System 1:
System 1 is universal wholeness. It distinguishes one active universal inside that relates to one passive
universal outside across one active interface between them. The active interface between them defines the
structural properties of all phenomenal experience, while the efflux and reflux of energy processes across the
active interface defines process properties to all phenomenal experience. The structural and process
properties of all phenomenal experience are generated together in this way. There are two ways to illustrate an
active interface or Center. One way is passive. The other way is active. This relates also to Higher Systems that
have more than one active interface and that are subsumed by System 1.

Passive Representation and Terms:
The passive representation illustrates the structural relationships of Centers with respect to their inside and
outside. System 1 is simply represented as one circle and there is only one relationship possible. System 2 is
represented by two circles and there are two relationships possible between them. System 3 is represented by
three circles and there are four possible relationships of inside to outside between them. System 4 is
represented by four circles and there are nine possible relationships between them, and so on. Each
relationship is called a Term. The passive representation only illustrates the structural relationships between
Centers. It says nothing of the active properties of Centers or of the active processes taking place between
Centers. It says nothing about the meaning implicit within Terms.

Active Representation, Terms, Modes, and Meaning:  
The active representation illustrates the active processes taking place within each Term. Each Center relates
to the other Centers within each Term through efflux and reflux. Together these processes within each Term
delineate a phenomenological basis to Meaning. In the higher systems there can be more than one way that
the centers within some Terms can actively relate. These alternate variations possible in some Terms are
called Modes. There are distinctions of meaning implicit between alternate Modes of the same Term. There are
a variety of ways that alternate Modes can arise.  

System 1 Transcending and Subsuming Space and Time:
System 1 as an expression of universal wholeness must transcend and subsume space and time as a posteriori
concepts derived from the structure and process of physical phenomena. Physical phenomena result from the
higher systems which are transcended and subsumed by System 1. If System 1 existed in space and time it
would create a universal boundary between inside and outside in space and time. It would constitute a
universal two-ness and thus a contradiction in terms. System 1 requires that all physical things must share both
a universal center or inside and a universal periphery or outside. This is a primary condition of universal
wholeness. It is the Meaning implicit in System 1.

The Rift in Wholeness:
Since System 1 is a unique Universal Center there is nothing to distinguish it in phenomenal experience as we
normally perceive space and time. As an isolated singular concept in itself it also allows of no phenomenal
experience and no space or time, since there is no other Center to perceive in reflux or relate to in efflux. Since
there can be no structure or process in experience apart from the undifferentiated wholeness of System 1,
nothing can be knowable. This is not consistent with our phenomenal experience. This means that there must
be a fundamental rift in wholeness. This rift must allow of multiple Particular Centers for the multiplicity of
phenomenal experience to be possible.

The Rift in Wholeness and Higher Systems:
The rift provides for System 2 as an elaboration of System 1. This is not a process in space and time. System 1
transcends and subsumes System 2. In a similar manner the rift further provides for System 3 as an elaboration
of System 2. It further provides for System 4 as an elaboration of System 3. The rift thus provides for a nested
hierarchy of higher Systems such that each higher system is an elaboration of the lower systems that
transcend and subsume them. Each higher System is designated by the number of Centers that generate it.

The Creative Process:
The creative process ensues from the need to reconcile the open ended proliferation of hierarchical multiplicity
with universal wholeness or unity. This is only possible if System 1 universally transcends and subsumes the
whole open ended hierarchy of higher systems via the structural dynamism of the creative process that it
prescribes. The whole creative process thus defines the efflux and reflux associated with System 1. This
requires that the whole of phenomenal existence is a process of dissemination from and return to a universal
active source on a cosmic scale.

(Private Note: The rift in wholeness was awesomely demonstrated by the infinite hemispheres of energy in the initial
experience that started this work. The experience also demonstrated the relationship between the Universal Center and myself
as a Particular Center transcending space and time and the whole of creation via System 2. When the Universal Center of
System 2 rose to consume the energies of the Void in reflux back to itself, it demonstrated itself as System 1, the Universal
Center of all creation. It could not complete this scenario because of the rift in wholeness. When I turned my back on the
Universal Center there was efflux of energy from it projecting through me as an open interface, as the experience continued to
demonstrate the higher Systems. The point here is that this glossary is derived primarily from the experiences in which the
System was revealed to me. Although there is a logical consistency to it confirmed by phenomenal experience it is not dependent
on a progressive logical construction based on language. It is structural and it does embrace all possible structural varieties of
phenomenal experience. It is because of these latter factors that these concepts do not have to be accepted as articles of belief
based on my private experiences. They can be independently confirmed in ordinary phenomenal experience and the empirical
evidence by others.)

System 2 Defines the Relationship Between Universal and Particular Centers:
System 2 defines a single Universal Center 1 in relation to manifold Particular Centers 2. Universal and
Particular aspects to phenomenal experience are mutually defined by System 2 as a fundamental relativity
principle. The one can only be known in relation to the other. No separate particular thing is completely unique
in phenomenal experience. Only Center 1 is Universal and Unique. Center 2 is Particular and Many. There
must be a hierarchical relationship between them if universal wholeness is to remain a possibility. They mutually
interact in only two possible structural orientations, each called a Term. One Term is defined as objective. The
other Term is defined as subjective.

Open Centers (System 2):
Both the Universal Center 1 and Particular Centers 2 are open in System 2. The Universal Center 1 is the
solitary archetypal active center synonymous with the active center of System 1. It universally transcends and
subsumes all Particular Centers 2. This is a fundamental hierarchical relationship. All Particular Centers 2 are
also open but the archetypal characteristics that they display in System 2 subsume particular aspects of the
higher Systems so that they relate in multiplicity to Center 1 as open particular Centers.

Open Centers and Higher Systems:
Open centers become progressively elaborated with each higher System, where they can assume additional
characteristics. For example their archetypal character as open centers can allow them to assimilate processes
at subsumed levels in a similar way that an organ in the body, such as a kidney, subsumes and assimilates the
cellular processes that constitute it. The kidney is a Particular active interface in its relationship with other
Particular body organs and yet it has an archetypal subsuming relationship to its collection of Particular cells at
a lower level (elaborated by a higher system) in the hierarchy. Each cell in turn has a subsuming relationship to
the collection of Particular molecular processes taking place within it. The System thus elaborates within itself.

The Illustration of Open Centers:
Active Open Centers are illustrated in diagrams by a plane two dimensional surface between inside and
outside, the plane of the active interface being indefinite in extent. Its extent depends upon the active
archetypal processes it exhibits (such as in a functioning kidney), and the Particular processes it subsumes,
according to its place in phenomenal circumstance. Centers with archetypal qualities exhibit organized energy
patterns. A hole is illustrated in the active two dimensional surface to distinguish the active process in efflux
from the inside to the outside.

Self-Similarity:
The hyphenated word “self-similar” is used to indicate a qualitative similarity between Universal and Particular
Centers, or between higher and lower Systems, or between the System and phenomena, or between different
phenomena that exhibit similar structural processes that correspond to the same System number. Self-similarity
indicates varying degrees of isomorphic relationships.

Closed Centers (Systems 3 and higher):
Systems 3 and higher have both open and closed Centers and both Universal and Particular Terms. The
Universal and Particular Terms of System 3 are self-similar elaborations of the Universal and Particular Centers
of System 2. Closed Centers first appear with System 3 and they are illustrated in the Active Representation
with ellipses. Closed Centers always occur as a triad of three separate Centers that are mutually bound in an
intimate process relationship between them. In System 3 the intimate relationship between the three Centers is
mutually confirmed by three self-similar Universal Centers confined within them and linking them in pairs.
Closed Centers always occur in every higher System in a self-similar triadic relationship. There are no possible
mutual relationships that can find closed self-similar confirmation between any other number of separate
Centers than three. It is always a triad. They must be mutually closed to maintain unified coherence within the
Term. Closed Centers exhibit spatial closure as a collection of three independent entities that together define
an intimate spatial relationship to one another. They also define a non-intimate spatial relationship to manifold
others of their kind. In Systems higher than System 3 intimate triadic relationships are elaborated upon. In
System 4 there are two such Terms one Universal and one Particular. In the Universal Term the triad of
separate closed Centers is contained within an open archetypal Center. In the Particular Term one of the
closed Centers of the triad contains an open Center within it. Each higher System elaborates in various ways.

Objective Orientation (System 2):
When Center 1 is the active center inside Center 2, all Centers 2 share the same universal center and relate in
efflux outward to the same universal periphery. All Centers 2 relate objectively outward. They can actively
participate in objective phenomenal experience. This orientation need not exclude the physical perception of
space and time although System 2 transcends and subsumes the generation of space and time by System 3.

(Private Note: There is an integrated archetypal energy pattern associated with each human being as an open Center 2 in
System 2. This active interface is an assimilation of one’s genetic, social and evolutionary history. As such under normal
circumstances it subsumes the higher systems and the phenomenal generation and perception of events in space and time,
including the physiology of our bodily functions. This is the normal circumstance in which we all live and share to various
degrees in phenomenal experience. Under special circumstances, such as the experience which initiated this work, the
projection of physical events can be transcended by the active relationship of the Universal Center to one Particular Center.
Alternate phenomenal experience can be generated at the active discretion of the Universal Center in a manner that transcends
the normal perception of events in space and time. Although the latter phenomenal experiences are revelatory in nature they can
not be capricious, since they too must conform to the structural and process characteristics of how the System works. There are
no other structural possibilities to phenomenal experience and the Universal Center represents holistic integrity.)

Subjective Orientation (System 2):
When Center 2 is separate from Center 1 it relates in relative passive reflux back to the active Universal
Center. It cannot relate in efflux because it is not the active Universal Center. The subjective orientation
transcends the physical perception of space and time. It is a subjective relationship because one Particular
Center objectively faces the unique Universal Center by relating subjectively inward in the context of the whole
cosmic order. The meaning of the words subjective and objective begins to compound within themselves as the
System proliferates within itself. The subjective orientation is always private. It cannot be public because the
Universal Center cannot admit of subjective multiplicity directly with respect to itself if it is to be Universal
Wholeness. It must be a one on one hierarchical relationship bridging the rift in wholeness through mutual
recognition. In the normal phenomenal experience of one human being the Subjective Orientation of System 2
involves private reflection. We know it as an intuitive process that seeks to integrate experience in some
meaningful way through wonder. We seek tuition within. It is a process of passive reflux to open archetypal
energies that transcend us. This intuitive search is not a linear process in space and time since it seeks to
meaningfully integrate objective events spanning their history. Center 2 of System 2 is an evolved product of
the creative process. It transcends and subsumes particular aspects of the higher systems.

(Private Note: Under normal circumstances we perceive physical phenomena in the objective orientation and we learn to
communicate to bridge our physical separation as physically distinct individuals. We make logical connections employing
language and develop common frameworks of understanding as intelligent beings. Our various sciences are developed to
organize our thoughts as mutual social endeavors in this way. We find a degree of unity bridging the rift in wholeness between
one another through these rational creative endeavors. We learn to cope together in civilized ways through our organizations of
many kinds. The alternate subjective orientation is consciously intuitive for humans under normal circumstances, and it is
progressively instinctive down the evolutionary ladder. The subjective intuitive orientation informs the objective rational
orientation. They alternately command our attention according to how we make our commitments. Under special circumstances
one Particular human can objectively face the Universal Center in passive reflux in the subjective orientation of System 2. This
can only be a private phenomenon, just as each person’s intuitive concerns are entertained privately. In this cosmic context in a
direct face to face relationship with the Universal Center the latter has universal access to the whole of history since it integrates
and subsumes the whole of phenomenal experience. It can re-assimilate Particular elements of historical experience from the
Void however it wishes to objectively reveal the structural dynamics of how the System integrates phenomenal experience. This
is how the cosmic order was revealed by the Supreme Universal Being in the cosmic insight that initiated this work and other
insights that followed.)

Perceptual Transpositions between Objective and Subjective Orientations:
The two orientations of System 2 occur alternately. In the objective orientation the Universal Center is inside
the Particular Center. In the subjective orientation the two Centers are separate and facing one another. The
transformations back and forth between one orientation and the other always occur by the Perceptual
Transposition of Center 2 with respect to Center 1. In general a perceptual transposition occurs when one or
more Centers in any System turn around to reverse or invert their subjective to objective orientation with
respect to one or more other Centers. Perceptual transpositions are always involved in the transformation from
one Term to another within any higher System.  In System 2 Center 2 turns around to face Center 1 in
transforming from the objective to the subjective orientation. The Universal Center 1 does not perceptually
transpose with respect to the Particular Center 2, because then Center 2 would become the Universal Center in
the objective orientation, a contradiction in meaning. The transformation to a subjective intuitive orientation in
System 2 is a matter of personal discretion influenced by the Universal Center within the objective orientation.

Homologues of System 2:
Homologues of System 2 can arise wherever a Particular Center is defined by its relationship to any Universal
Center in a higher system. A Universal Center does not have to be the Universal Center of the cosmos
although it may contain it. Homologues arise in the relationship of a Particular member of a species to the
Universal genotype of the species. Rover is defined as a dog in relation to its species. Both one Particular dog
and the Universal Dog Species are open active interfaces defined by System 2.

In a restricted context homologues can arise in all definitions, where physical things are mentally classified as
members of a set or a group. For example a drafting pencil may be defined by its relationship to a universal
class called a set of drafting instruments. The word “set” in this context is different from its use in Systems 3
and higher. As a general rule of the System each Particular Center of one Particular Set must correspond to a
self-similar Universal Center in a corresponding Universal Set that interacts with all Particular Sets. In System 2,
a Set is confined to one Universal Center, or to one Particular Center of the self-similar Universal kind. In the
higher Systems the word Set designates an intimate relationship between the number of Centers consistent
with the System number that are mutually bound by a self-similar Universal Set.

System 2 and Values:
The two alternate orientations of System 2 represent a rift in universal wholeness. In the objective orientation
each Particular Center 2 must objectively relate to other Particular Centers 2. Although they are open centers
they all subsume the higher systems that invest them with separate physical forms in the projection of space
and time. This phenomenal experience of objective multiplicity must find reconciliation with the subjective
holistic orientation that one seeks through open intuitive wonder. This requires that we must seek some way to
meaningfully integrate the diversity of objective circumstance into a common framework of understanding.
Universal values derive from this need to reconcile unity and multiplicity associated with the two orientations of
System 2 transcending and subsuming events in space and time. In a human context, friendship, love,
goodness, mercy, compassion, all derives from the intuitive realization that we share an archetypal Universal
Center with others. We are all human beings. What we do to another we do to ourselves also. The archetypal
Center is our common humanity implicit in the genotype of the human species. System 1 also requires that our
common archetypal humanity must have a cosmic Universal Center within it from which all values derive. In a
cosmic context we intuitively recognize that there must be a transcending universal basis to truth. Values are
the meaning implicit in the identity between the two orientations of System 2.

System 3, Sets, and Frames:
The three Centers of System 3 generate four Terms that interact in two Sets, consistent with an elaboration of
System 2. Each Set consists of three Centers that alternate between two Terms. One Set is Universal and
unique. One Set is Particular and many. Consistent with System 2 there are alternate objective and subjective
orientations. In each orientation one Universal Term interacts with one Particular Term of each Particular Set to
constitute a mutually coherent Frame. The subjective orientation is called a Space Frame. The objective
orientation is called a Quantum Frame.

System 3 and Photon, Electron and Proton:
At the most primary level the three Particular Centers of each Particular Set of System 3 are identified as
Photon (C1), Electron (C2) and Proton (C3). The unique Universal Set consists of three self-similar open
Centers that interact with the three Particular Centers in each Particular Set.  The primary projection of space
and time results from the synchronous projection of Particular Sets, each set being an independent atom.
Independent atoms are linked by the efflux of light that provides the integrated fabric Space Frames with the
appearance of spatial continuity. Light defines the space between atoms. Each integrated Space Frame
alternates with its timeless quantum energy equivalent. The integrated Quantum Frame, called the Void. The
timeless Void is orthogonal to the integrated fabric of space-time. It spans and integrates history.

The Subjective Space Frame and Coherence:
In each Particular Set of the Space Frame the three Centers that constitute one Set are mutually closed and
thus spatially distinct from one another. They are contained by physical boundaries that define them as
Particular Wholes and through which they mutually relate in an intimately bound subjective state as a single
closed entity such as an atom that exists in three spatial dimensions. At a primary atomic level the three spatial
dimensions are defined by the way the three Centers of the unique Universal Set are confined within the three
Particular Centers of each Particular Set to intimately bind them together as distinct atoms. This intimate
binding is called Coherence. The confinement of the Universal Set is similar to the way quarks are believed to
be confined.

Spatial Extension and System 3 Homologues:
Spatial extension is defined by the objective relationship between separate Particular entities in the subjective
orientation. One subjective Space Frame defines one atom. One integrated Space Frame defines the objective
relationship between all atoms and thus the ontological structure of physical existence. There are self-similar
homologues to System 3 as it relates both to the celestial integration of space and time and to the physical
seeding of biological evolution. There are also purely biological homologues associated with the intimate
integration of Host, Organ and Cell in multi-celled creatures. There are further homologues within the Cell.

The Objective Quantum Frame of System 3, and the Void:
The three Centers of each Particular Set are open in the objective Quantum Frame and thus they lose closed
physical form. They remain intimately bound by their mutual coalescence as a timeless quantum of organized
energy. Two of the Centers coalesce together, face to face, within the remaining Center such that the universal
center and periphery are simultaneously realized. This mutual coalescence of the three Centers is a unit
quantum of energy that is the equivalent of each Particulate atomic entity in the Subjective Space Frame. The
simultaneous relationship between the universal inside and outside gives each Particular Set its timeless
quality. Centers 2 and 3 of each Particular Set become coalesced as Center 1. In other words Electron and
Proton coalesce to become Photonic energy. Each coalesced Particular Set thus becomes an element of the
Universal Center 1 in light. Because both the Universal and Particular Centers are open in the objective
Quantum Frame, the Universal Center 1 assimilates all Particular Sets as One. This Universal Center 1 relates
objectively outward through the universal Centers 2 and 3 to the universal periphery in darkness. The
integration of all Particular Quantum Sets by a single unique Universal Set in the Quantum Frame is called the
Void. It is a timeless and spatially indeterminate field of quantized energy without specific form. It is also called
the Quantum Sensorium. It is a master memory bank from which the world of form is recalled in each Space
Frame.

Transformations between Space and Quantum Frames:
Each Particular Set transforms from the Space Frame to the Quantum Frame by the perceptual transformation
of the Particular Center 1 such that it turns around to contain Centers 2 and 3. The Universal Set transforms to
the Quantum Frame by the perceptual transposition of Center 3 such that it contains Centers 1 and 2. The two
transformations complement one another in the switch to the alternate Frame. They transform in an inverse
manner to one another. The transformations back and forth between Space and Quantum Frames are
synchronously regulated by the Universal Set.

The Primary Interval of Time:
There is no particulate motion in a single Space Frame, only electromagnetic activity. All relative motions occur
as quantum jumps in position between successive Space Frames. A primary interval of linear time is defined in
relation to the zero angular momentum of the electron in the first orbit of the hydrogen atom in relation to the
Coulomb Force that retains it in orbit between successive space frames. The Primary Interval of Time is easily
calculated to have a value of  1.519 x 10^-16 seconds. This is the duration of each still space frame projection
in classical units of time with respect to electromagnetic frequency and Planck's universal constant h.

Synchronicity and Space-time:
The Universal Set synchronously projects all atoms in the universe in a succession of integrated space frames
with the phenomenal characteristics of spatial continuity. Between each integrated Space Frame there is a
timeless integrated Quantum Frame from which each Space Frame is synchronously recalled to physical form.
Because each Quantum Frame is timeless the Space Frames close ranks to give the appearance of spatial
continuity. At the atomic level the synchronous recurrence of space frames is very rapid giving the appearance
of both spatial and temporal continuity. This is called the integrated fabric of Space-Time. It is distinct from the
a priori concept of the spacetime continuum of General Relativity. Since the Void is timeless it can span and
integrate the history of evolutionary change in the integrated fabric of space-time.

Inner and Outer Space and the Quantization of Space-time:
Inner space is defined by the complex of relationships between self-similar Universal and Particular Sets that
define each atom as a spatially distinct entity. External space is defined by the emission of light from exited
atoms so that external space is defined by the distance light can travel in one primary interval of time relative to
each atom. In this way both space and time are quantized. One quantum element of space is the distance that
light can travel in one primary interval of time. It is 4.554 x 10^-8 meters.

The Uncertainty Principle:
The wave-particle duality of matter derives from the synchronous transformations between space frames and
quantum frames. Each atom behaves somewhat like a standing wave. Each atom is both a discrete particle and
a quantized element of timeless energy at the same time, because a primary interval of time is equivalent to
one cycle of recurrence of each synchronous atom. Since the exact position of an atom can only be known in a
single space frame, and since momentum requires a number of successive space frames involving successive
jumps in position in order to determine it, this accounts for the uncertainty principle. The more precisely
position can be known the less precisely momentum can be known and vice-versa. This is a function of h/2pi.

Relative Space Frame Skipping and Atomic Fusion:
Light, emanating from stars, links up all the synchronously projected atoms in the universe to present the
integrated fabric of space-time that we know as phenomenal experience. Relative motions only occur as jumps
in position between successive Space Frames. This introduces relative space frame skipping since the
transmission of light cannot fully bridge relative quantum jumps in position between space frames. Relative
Space Frame skipping accounts for Special and General Relativity effects. Space frame skipping can be
compensated for by atomic fusion in the centers of suns. Atomic fusion combines two atoms that define a space
less than one primary atom of hydrogen. Fusion processes in the centers of stars thus condense space and
time.

Electromagnetic Fields Spanning Space-Time:
When an Electron is separated from its Proton partner and thus from the inner space of an atom within a single
Space Frame, it is beyond the reach of the Universal Set that binds them intimately to the Photon in the
Particular Set. The three members of the Particular Set still remain intimately coalesced in the Quantum Frame.
This requires that Photonic energy must span and integrate two or more Space Frames to intimately link
Electron and Proton and complete the Set. Electromagnetic fields result from this spanning of space frames by
Photonic energy. EM fields can reach to the ends of Space-Time. They pervade the universe. They span
space and time.

General Meanings of System 3 Centers as subsumed by System 2:
The general meanings of the System 3 Centers derive from the objective orientation of the Universal Set. In this
objective Term C1 is inside C2 which is inside C3. As an elaboration of System 2, C1 represents universal
wholeness, just as it did in System 2. System 3 elaborates on System 2 by the same rift in wholeness that
requires that there must be a System 2 to find confirmation with the multiplicity of phenomenal experience. C2
in System 2 can only be an open Center with archetypal characteristics. This presents the same dilemma as in
System 1, since a monolithic archetypal Center can allow of no phenomenal distinctions apart from itself.
Center 2 must allow of a subsumed level of distinction as an additional active Center 3 in System 3. The
meaning implicit in C1 is universal wholeness in Systems 1, 2 and 3. We can call it the Idea of wholeness in
order to generalize it for application to ordinary experience. The transformation back and forth between the
objective and subjective orientations of System 2 is a self-similar recurrent Routine. It is a universal action that
always employs the same perceptual transposition of Center 2 to result in the alternate orientation. There is
thus always a Routine involved between the Form of the subjective orientation and the universal wholeness
which is the Idea implicit in the Objective orientation. System 3 elaborates on this System 2 Routine that
transforms to a subjective Form. In System 3, Center 2 is designated as an explicit Routine. Center 3 is
designated as explicitly representing the Form of the Subjective orientation. The three Centers of System 3 are
thus associated with a holistic Idea, a Routine of transformation, and an explicit subjective Form that results
from the transformation.
This is represented in the System 3 hierarchy as Idea C1->Routine C2->Form C3->Universal outside (darkness).

Meanings of System 3 Transformations:
In the Universal Objective Term of System 3 there is a time-like succession in the efflux from C1 to C2 to C3 to
darkness. C1 also contains all of the coalesced Particular Sets that are holistic quantized elements of C1 as
light energy in the objective orientation of the Quantum Frame, which is the Void. Through the efflux from the
universal C1 to the universal Routine interface C2 the transformation to the Subjective orientation takes place
as explicit Form. All of the particular Centers 1 perceptually transpose to face their C2 and C3 partners as
closed intimately bound Sets of independent atoms. Simultaneously the unique universal Form Center 3
perceptually transposes to give independent Form to each Particular Center. Each Particular Center becomes
intimately bound to its two partners across the inner space subjectively defined for each atom. This Universal
binding takes place between Particular pairs of Centers in self-similar order between Routine C2 and Form C3.
This means that the Universal open relationship between Electron and Proton with each atom corresponds to
the closed Particular relationship between Electron and Proton. All atoms are self-similar and synchronous.

Relational Whole in Efflux:
In the subjective universal Term of System 3, C1 is inside or subjective to C2 and thus relates in efflux out
through C2 to enter C3 which has perceptually transposed to objectively face C2. This completes what is called
a Relational Whole since C1 and C3 share a common Universal inside. This sharing a common inside is
required by System 1. The Relational Whole thus completes a circuit back to the universal inside. In this case
the Relational Whole is created by active efflux from C1 through C2 to re-enter C3. All Relational Wholes are
designated by the letter R with a numerical subscript to identify it.

Relational Whole in Reflux:
In the same subjective universal Term of System 3, C3 relates in passive Reflux back to enter through C2 and
thence C1 to complete a countercurrent Relational Whole in the universal inside. This passive reflux provides
feedback from the Form C3 to the integrating Idea C1 via the Routine C2. Together the Relational Wholes in
efflux and reflux are called Countercurrent Relational Wholes.

Common Meaning of Countercurrent Relational Wholes in Efflux and Reflux:
All creative activity in a human context has a self-similar universal pattern. Any integrating Idea takes explicit
Form through active Routines of some kind. If we have an integrated Idea to make a picture, the picture takes
on an explicit Form through the Routines of drawing or painting. The Form of the picture feeds back in passive
reflux through the active Routines until we see that it matches the Idea we have in mind. This universal pattern
defines a subjective aspect distinct from an objective aspect. System 3 is also called the Primary Activity.

Coherence of the Universal Term with all Particular Terms in the System 3 Space Frame:
The three Centers in each Particular Set are intimately bound by the Universal Countercurrent Relational
Wholes tunneling through them from within and linking them up in self-similar pairs. This synchronous intimate
binding of each Particular Set by a single Universal Set is called Coherence. It accounts for the physical identity
of separate atoms of hydrogen on the integrated Space Frame side. The identity between separate atoms is
called an Aristotelian Identity. It does not take cognizance of the identity between Space and Quantum Frames.
There is also a Triadic Identity associated with the intimate binding of the three Particular Centers in each
Particular Set by the Universal Set. The Universal Set is confined within Particular Centers, like quarks.

Historic Integration and Physical Conjugate Identities:
Conjugate Identities between atoms, electrons, protons, and other sub-atomic particles arise when
relationships between separate atomic Space Frames become Historically Integrated over a succession of
Space Frames with respect to the integrated Quantum Framethe timeless Void. The timeless Void spans
space and time and takes account of historic reflux. This must be reconciled historically on the integrated
Space Frame side. Conjugate Identities involving relative motions thus account for relativistic effects.
Conjugate Identities involving the charge relationship between electron and proton account for the Coulomb
Force. Conjugate Identities between separate atoms or collections of atoms as material bodies account for the
Gravitational Force.

Historic Integration and the Quantization of Space and Time:
Historic Integration associated with the Conjugate Identity takes account of the inverse relationship between
Space Frames and Quantum Frames via the quantization of space and time. Discrete increments of space and
time are integrated with respect to the Void in a manner analogous to the integration of differential increments
in the calculus. The difference is that the System does not allow for infinitesimal differentiation. The differentials
involved in Historic Integration are specified by the discrete quantized elements of space and time.

Secondary Homologue of System 3 in the Integrated Fabric of Space-Time:
Galaxies have no physical existence in phenomenal experience apart from their stellar populations. There is
nevertheless an integrated fabric of space-time associated with each galaxy via the timeless Void that spans
and integrates history. Space-time is progressively contracted near galactic centers with an event horizon at
their centers that is called a black hole in the integrated fabric of space-time. Black holes are singular
conditions shared by galactic centers in the primary projection of hydrogen via the Void. Black holes function
as Universal Centers of historic efflux and reflux via the Void. There is thus a universal pattern associated with
each galaxy as a coherent entity on a cosmic scale. As galactic cells eternally regenerating their stellar
populations, they evolve and change. The integrating Idea finds translation into the galactic Form of its stellar
population via its Routines of relative angular motion. This is called the Secondary Homologue of System 3.

Warping Space-Time by Space Frame Skipping:
It is relative angular motions that introduce relative space frame skipping at galactic centers with respect to
their peripheries. This contracts the integrated fabric of space-time, driving the nucleosynthesis of heavier
elements that contract space-time in suns to compensate. The integrated Idea of galaxies on a cosmic scale
thus finds translation into their physical stellar Form via their relative angular Routines. There is empirical
evidence of periodic efflux of primary hydrogen from the singular condition shared by galactic centers as well
as reflux of old dense stars back to eventual accretion into a black hole at galactic centers. The contraction of
space-time at the centers of galaxies propels primal hydrogen radially outward and draws old dense stars back
in. The holistic Idea of a galaxy is realized in Form through the Routines of stellar regeneration. This constitutes
the Secondary Homologue of System 3 associated with the Primary System 3 and the cosmic projection of
hydrogen.

Tertiary Homologue of System 3 and Molecular Synthesis:
A Tertiary Homologue is associated with inorganic molecular synthesis that takes place with the accretion of
planets in a second generation solar system and with their subsequent circumstances in the solar disc.
Elemental atoms in the Quantum Frame have open Centers. They are coalesced as quantized units of photonic
energy related to the outer electron orbit. As each such quantum energy equivalent is recalled to Form it
becomes translated via the Universal Routine Interface that can assimilate open Particular Centers if they
should spatially contact during the process of transformation to Form. Two or more atoms can become bound
into a molecule by sharing electrons in their outer orbits if it results in a combined lower energy state. The
random motions and collisions of compatible elemental atoms in the process of transformation between frames
can combine atoms under the circumstances provided by planets. So the holistic Idea of unity finds a tertiary
expression in inorganic molecular Form via chance Routines. This Tertiary Homologue of System 3 takes place
within the context of the Secondary Homologue. Planets become experimental laboratories for chemical
synthesis, exploring a vast range of conditions. Although Particular planets have an origin in a space-time
context, they are expressions of a transcending universal pattern that has no beginning or end in space-time.

A Discontinuous Universe, the Red Shift and the Background Radiation:
In the discontinuous universe prescribed by the System the red shift of distant galaxies and the background
radiation both have alternate explanations. Although a red shift may be associated with recessional velocity via
relative Space Frame skipping, the same phenomenon is also associated with great distance alone. The
relative historic reflux of stellar populations as observed through the integrated fabric of space-time is not in
synchronization with an observer in a distant galaxy. It can be out of synchronization by billions of light years
involving a history of relative Space Frame skipping. The distant galaxy nevertheless shares a synchronous
present via the timeless Void. The reconciliation of these conjugate perspectives on the integrated Space
Frame side can account for a variety of observational effects including the red shift of distant galaxies. The
relative skipping in the Space Frames of the observer shifts the light spectra of distant galaxies toward the red
end of the spectrum. The associated longer wavelength of light from the distant galaxy indicates that light itself
is being historically refluxed back to the Universal Center together with the stellar reflux of its source. Historic
integration associated with the synchronous primary projection of hydrogen can also account for the
background radiation as perceived from terrestrial observations.

System 4 and Knowledge:
The Idea of unity takes on a different flavor resulting from the primary activity of System 3 and its two celestial
homologues. The physical universe assumes the character of an integrated physical whole synonymous with
space-time that is matched by the holistic character of the timeless Void spanning space-time. Light links
everything up and electromagnetic fields physically span space-time over a linear history of change. The
physical universe is in communication with itself through electromagnetic processes. There is a kind of knowing
involved associated with information exchange on a physical level. This information transfer is not spontaneous
in the integrated fabric of space-time because it is limited by the speed of light which defines space in relation
to the primary interval of time. This involves the Rift in Universal Wholeness. On the integrated Space Frame
side we look out through a history of change to the limits of the cosmos, while on the Quantum Frame side the
whole of history is integrated timelessly. Through our largest telescopes we see mere fossils of ancient light
that finally reach us from afar, while on the other quantum side everything is present as quantized energy all at
once.

This aspect of the rift in wholeness must find reconciliation in some meaningful way. The Idea of Universal
Wholeness associated with Systems 1, 2, and 3, must admit of Knowledge of the creative process from within
the integrated fabric of space-time. It must do this to reconcile linear history with the timeless Void. An
additional Center identified as Knowledge is thus distinguished in System 4 as an elaboration of System 3 and
its two homologues. Knowledge is invested in the creation. The Primary Universal Hierarchy of System 4 thus
has C1 (Holistic Idea) inside C2 (Knowledge) inside C3 (Routine) inside C4 (Form). In human experience we all
know that Idea directs Knowledge which directs Routines which gives direction to physical Form in any creative
process. This can be written as a sequence C1->C2->C3->C4->periphery. A central Idea becomes translated
through Knowledge and Routines into a Form that relates in efflux to the peripheral environment. We have an
Idea and we Know how to translate it through a Routine of action into a Form. This final Form we can identify in
reflux and as consistent with the Idea we have in mind. We can see it take form through our routines of action
that we knowingly direct.

System 4 and the Panspermia Seeds of Biological Evolution:
System 4 relates to living biological processes that evolve within the physical creation associated with System 3
and its homologues. It is an elaboration of System 3. It is not a causal consequence of System 3 in space-time.
The System prescribes the structural dynamics of all phenomena including space-time and admits of no origin
in space-time. The System indicates that organic life also has a cosmic origin without a beginning in space time.
It did not arise as a spontaneous series of inorganic chemical accidents peculiar to this Particular Planet Earth.
There is a universal archetype associated with invested Knowledge of space-time in System 4 that applies to all
organic life on all planets that can host organic life. This suggests that the Panspermia Theory first proposed
by Svante Arhenius, the 1903 Nobel Laureate in chemistry, has a basis in empirical fact. According to the
theory, further developed by Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, microscopic spores of prokaryotic cells and perhaps
some eukaryotic cells can survive the rigors of interstellar space and constitute a cosmic gene pool in space.
They can be carried to inner solar systems by comets and are small enough to ride on the radiation pressure
of starlight. They can thus radiate outward into the solar system disc in efflux where they have a chance of a
soft landing on planets with moderate atmospheres, such as Earth. The gene pool can be replenished in reflux
by ejection processes. There is evidence that this activity of spore seeding is still taking place on Earth. In itself
it is of a physical nature associated with System 3 and its homologues. However the germination and
evolutionary development of the seeds is governed primarily by Systems 4 and higher.

The Nine Terms of System 4 and the Creative Matrix:
There are only nine possible ways that four Centers can relate to one another with respect to a universal inside
and outside as prescribed by System 1. Each of the nine Terms has a coherent pattern of active processes
between the Centers within it. This active representation of each Term implicitly defines a creative basis to
meaning. The nine Terms dynamically interact in Universal and Particular Sets called the Creative Matrix.

The Universal and Particular Sets of System 4:
There are two Universal Sets, one of them Primary and one of them Secondary. Each Universal Set has its own
transform sequence that intimately coheres with the other Universal Set. This elaborates in a self-similar
manner to the way the Universal and Particular Terms of System 3 are intimately related. There are three
Particular Sets that synchronously transform through a specific six Term sequence, each Set one Step apart.
The Universal transform sequences regulate and subsume the Particular transform sequences.

The Operating Field and Biospheric Resonance:
The creative matrix requires an operating field which is provided by the active interface of the planet in its
intimate relationship to the solar system. As the seeds of organic life germinate and develop, the active
interface of the planet becomes transformed into the biosphere. The biosphere resonates and elaborates upon
the tidal and electromagnetic influences prescribed by System 3 and its homologues. The evolutionary record
is replete with examples of biospheric resonance throughout the ages, where complementary species have
evolved independently in geographical isolation on opposite sides of the planet.

The Meanings Implicit in Each of the Nine Terms of System 4 are Listed as Follows:
• Term 1: Perception of Response Capacity to the Operating Field (Particular)
• Term 2: Creation of Idea (Particular) (This Relational Idea is distinct from C1.)
• Term 3: Transference of Idea into Form (Secondary Universal)
• Term 4: Organization of Sensory Input (Particular) (also called Mental Work)
• Term 5: Physical Response to Input (Particular) (also called Physical Work)
• Term 6: Corporeal Body (Secondary Universal)
• Term 7: Quantized Memory Sequence (Particular) (also called Resource Capacity)
• Term 8: Perceptual Balance of Physical Output to Sensory Input (Particular)
• Term 9: Universal Discretionary Hierarchy C1->C2->C3->C4-> (Primary Universal)

Expressive and Regenerative Modes of the Six Particular Terms:
With the exception of Term 8, the Particular Terms have alternating expressive and regenerative modes
associated with efflux and reflux respectively. This is accommodated by C1 and C2 switching positions within
each Particular Set in the transformations to and from Term 8 in the six Term sequence. The Particular Term 8
is always in the Expressive Mode.

Steps in the Transform Sequence of the Particular Sets:
The Particular Transform Sequence is specified by the inverse of the memory Term 7. It is 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7,
repeating to infinity. The transformation from one Term number to the next in the sequence is called a Step.

## The Alternate Particular Groupings and Tensional Coupling:
The three Particular Sets synchronously transform through the Six Step Sequence one Step apart.
This provides for two Alternate Groupings.
Terms 8, 7, 4 are called the Implicit Grouping and it alternates with Terms 1, 2, 5, called the Explicit Grouping.
This elaborates on the alternating Quantum and Space Frames of System 3.
Terms 4 and 7 are said to be Tensionally Coupled.
Memory recall always relates to sensory input.
When Term 4 is in the expressive Mode, Term 7 is in the regenerative Mode, and vice versa.
Terms 2 and 5 are also Tensionally Coupled.
A physical response to sensory input always relates to creation of a relational idea.
Terms 2 and 5 alternately occur together in the Expressive Mode then together in the Regenerative Mode.
Each Grouping repeats its Mode alignment every four Steps.
There can be many Alternating Particular Groupings working in parallel.
For example there are many parallel routes in the human sensory and motor apparatus,
all of them involving the same number of parallel synapses that correspond to the Step by Step Term transformations.
The nervous system has evolved in precise structural accord with how the System works.

Cycles:
A Cycle consists of four Steps. Each Cycle begins in Step 1 with a Term 4 of one Particular Set in the
Expressive Mode of the Implicit Grouping. This brings new sensory input to the creative matrix at the beginning
of a Cycle and also initiates a compatible pattern of Regenerative recall via Term 7 (T7R). In Step 2 of each
Cycle Terms 2 and 5 respond in the Expressive Mode. The Regenerative Mode predominates in the last two
Steps of each Cycle. Since each Set must go through both an Expressive and a Regenerative Mode, a total of
twelve Steps or Three Cycles is required to complete the whole sequence.

The Transform Sequence of the Primary Universal Set:
The Primary Universal Set begins each Cycle in the Term 9 (UT9) orientation where it stays for two Particular
Steps. UT9 represents the progressive efflux of the Universal Idea Center C1 through C2, C3, and C4 to a
universal periphery. Since it is synonymous with the Void it has universal access to Particular quantized
elements of the Void.  It accesses related parallel quantized memory sequences of a regenerative nature
(T7Rs) from the Void in Step 1. These recalled quantized elements together represent archetypal
Regenerative Knowledge (C2) as a Step-like progression from quantized Idea (C1 with C3-C4 coalesced
inside) consistent with the Step-like progression to the Universal Knowledge Center of UT9 in Step 2. (This can
be seen from the respective diagrams of each Term.) Term 9 then transforms to a Universal Regenerative
Term 8 (UT8R) where it stays for two Steps to integrate all the parallel Particular Terms 8 (T8E) in Step 3. Then
it integrates all the Particular Expressive Ideas (T2E) in Step 4, thus reconciling the universal distribution of
energy resources available for an integrated physical response to input. The UT8R Term transforms back to
UT9 to begin each new Cycle. The transform sequence of the Primary Universal Set is thus back and forth
between UT9 and UT8R, but in double Steps.

The Transform Sequence of the Secondary Universal Set:
The Secondary Universal Set begins Step 1 of each Cycle in the Term 3 (UT3) orientation. It works in intimate
conjunction with UT9 which accesses an integrated Regenerative Idea as Knowledge and it represents the
assimilation of this Idea into Form through the coalescence of Knowledge and Routine. In Step 2 the Set
transforms to UT6, the corporeal body, where it stays for two Steps. In UT6 the Idea C1 is explicitly represented
as closed in an intimate relationship to closed Knowledge C2 and Routine C3 Centers within the open physical
context of the whole body as part of the physical environment C4. Each human being has there own Ideas,
Knowledge and Routines for example with their physical Form which is synchronous with all physical Form. The
physical extent of the closed C1, C2 and C3 is thus limited. C1, C2 and C3 exist as a closed triadic relationship
within the open Center C4 as an elaboration of the closed triad of System 3 Space Frame. In Step 3 the UT8R
Term intimately coheres with it, as an elaboration of the way the Universal Term coheres with and intimately
binds the three Particular Terms in the Space Frame of System 3. In Step 4, the UT6 term transforms to a
Universal Expressive Idea Term (UT2E) that coincides with and integrates all Particular Regenerative Terms
(T2Rs). The UT8R Term coheres with it again, this time distributing energy resources to the anticipated
expression of the regenerative sequence. The Secondary Universal Set transforms from UT2E back to UT3 to
begin the next Cycle. The transform sequence is thus UT3 to UT6 for two Steps then UT2E for one Step, then
back to UT3. This is consistent with an elaboration of System 3 and also with the evidence of phenomenal
experience. It explains many questions relating to the integrated behavior of complex multi-cellular creatures for
which no explanations are currently available.

Historic Integration by the Expressive and Regenerative Modes:   
The action sequence of the Expressive Mode represents a conditioned response that automatically responds
to sensory input as a cause and effect relationship. It is driven by past conditioning in efflux. The Regenerative
Mode simulates an anticipated future in a manner that generates feedback via sensory reflux. In the vertebrate
animals this involves the proprioceptive nervous system. Since both modes occur synchronously in the three
Particular Sets they must find mutual reconciliation. Past and future thus become Historically Integrated
spanning space and time in an ongoing present. As humans we do this as a matter of course. Born the most
helpless of creatures we must learn everything in order to anticipate future needs and perform from moment to
moment. Through written language we can draw on the learning experience of past generations. Our sciences
search through terrestrial and cosmic history for laws that allow us to understand the structural dynamics of
events and predict the future. To the extent that we can do this in a manner consistent with the cosmic order we
develop a timeless understanding. This relates to the Void as a Conjugate Identity. The realization of this living
conjugate identity transcends both space-time and the Void. (This is possible through the relationship of a
Particular Human Center to the Universal Cosmic Center via the subjective orientation of System 2. This
realization transcends the whole of history.)

The Evolutionary and Involutionary Variants of the System:
There are two variants possible in Systems 3 and higher. One is called the Evolutionary Variant because it
progressively integrates experience toward a timeless understanding. The other is called the Involutionary
Variant because it is degenerate. It leads to decay. In System 3 the Involutionary Variant results if the Universal
Set links up the Centers of the Particular Set in reverse order. The universal relationship between Routine and
Form becomes reversed with respect to the Particular relationship between Routine and Form. Anti-matter
results at the atomic level. In System 4 the Involutionary Variant elaborates on that of System 3. It occurs when
Particular Centers 3 and 4 exchange places in Particular Terms. Forms relate to Routines as ends in
themselves. Values become inverted. Things are done for their own sake apart from their pragmatic value in an
evolutionary context. In System 4 the Evolutionary and Involutionary Variants share common perceptual
referents via Term 1. This allows one variant to feed on the other. The Involutionary Variant can fragment the
Evolutionary Variant but the latter can also redeem the energies of the former. This struggle between opposing
tendencies permeates the higher systems of the creative process. It accounts for everything from human strife
to pestilence and disease. It also accounts for the majestic redeeming features of the natural order.

The Evolutionary Hierarchy of System 4:
Evolutionary development always begins at the Form level (C4) of the UT9 Term and proceeds level by level
back up the Universal Hierarchy. Biological evolutionary development in the biosphere got under way with the
exploration of the static Form of the eukaryotic cell by plants. It moved up to the Routine level (C3) with the
exploration of huge variety of sensory-motor mechanisms by the invertebrate animals. It moved up to the
Knowledge level (C2) with the exploration of conscious patterns of emotive behavior by the vertebrate animals.
They became invested with an autonomic nervous system that reflects emotional animating energies into
cerebral awareness. It moved up to the Idea level (C1) with humans who are invested with creative abilities
associated with spoken and written language and the need to use it to cope, due to a vulnerable body format.
From the top down the hierarchy proceeds from creative energies (C1) to conscious energies (C2), to sensitive
energies (C3) to vital energies (C4).

The Discretionary Hierarchy of Human Behavior:
Human Ideas are generated by electronic processes (C1) in the neurons of the central nervous system. The
electronic processes give specific direction to the labyrinth of synaptic interconnections of cell processes (C2)
which represents invested Knowledge accumulated through ones cultural, genetic and evolutionary history.
The neuronal interconnections transmit through the peripheral nervous system to the gross body processes
(C3) of muscles that animate skeletal linkages and the internal organs that fuel them. The animated action
sequences alter the body’s external physical form as it relates to the physical environment. From this UT9 Term
the other Terms of System 4 follow accordingly. The Discretionary Human Hierarchy subsumes the Biological
Evolutionary Hierarchy.

The Three Polar Dimensions of Human Behavior:
The creation of idea in T2 has a polar relationship to resource capacity in T7 that provides insight into the
Potential Dimension of human behavior. Resource capacity is sterile without creative ideas and vice-versa. The
potential dimension is focused through the intuitive right hemisphere of the brain. Physical action in T5 has a
polar relationship to the organization of sensory input in T4 that provides insight into the Commitment
Dimension of human behavior. Physical behavior relates to how we organize our sensory experience into a
framework of understanding. It is focused through the left hemisphere of the brain concerned with formulating
explicit techniques of behavior with language. The balance of motor output with sensory input in T8 has a polar
relationship to our perceived response capacity to the environment in T1. This polarity provides insight into the
Performance Dimension. In T1 we emotionally feel a need and capacity to act via the autonomic nervous
system according to sensory input. The degree of motor balance to sensory input in T8 is evaluated in the
context of our perceived capacity to respond to this need. Our performance does not always match our
expectations. These three polar dimensions of the Particular Terms provide us with insight into the specifics of
human behavior.

It is the one that leads to decay.
