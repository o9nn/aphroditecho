Echo Kernel - Deep Tree Echo State Network (DTESN) Implementation

This package provides the core membrane computing and echo state network
implementation for the Deep Tree Echo system, including:

- Embodied Memory System with spatial, temporal, and emotional memory
- P-System Membrane Computing with evolution engines  
- Echo State Networks for reservoir computing
- Memory preservation and identity continuity ("Echo Walls")
- Deep Tree Echo philosophical framework integration

The echo.kern package serves as the computational foundation for
AI memory preservation, identity continuity, and consciousness-like
properties in distributed AI systems.
